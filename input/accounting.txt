A note about copyright
Dear Customer
What does the little © mean and why does it matter?
Your market-leading BPP books, course materials and
e-learning materials do not write and update themselves. People write
them: on their own behalf or as employees of an organisation that
invests in this activity. Copyright law protects their livelihoods. It
does so by creating rights over the use of the content.
Breach of copyright is a form of theft – as well as being a criminal
offence in some jurisdictions, it is potentially a serious breach of
professional ethics.
With current technology, things might seem a bit hazy but, basically,
without the express permission of BPP Learning Media:
• Photocopying our materials is a breach of copyright
• Scanning, ripcasting or conversion of our digital materials into
different file formats, uploading them to facebook or emailing
them to your friends is a breach of copyright
You can, of course, sell your books, in the form in which you have
bought them – once you have finished with them. (Is this fair to your
fellow students? We update for a reason.) But the e-products are sold
on a single user licence basis: we do not supply ‘unlock’ codes to
people who have bought them second-hand.
And what about outside the UK? BPP Learning Media strives to make
our materials available at prices students can afford by local printing
arrangements, pricing policies and partnerships which are clearly
listed on our website. A tiny minority ignore this and indulge in
criminal activity by illegally photocopying our material or supporting
organisations that do. If they act illegally and unethically in one area,
can you really trust them?

vi Introduction
Effective revision
This guidance applies if you have been studying for an assessment over a period of time. (Some tuition providers
are teaching subjects by means of one intensive course that ends with the assessment.)
What you must remember
Time is very important as you approach the assessment. You must remember:
Believe in yourself
Use time sensibly
Believe in yourself
Are you cultivating the right attitude of mind? There is absolutely no reason why you should not pass this
assessment if you adopt the correct approach.
• Be confident – you've passed exams before, you can pass them again
• Be calm – plenty of adrenaline but no panicking
• Be focused – commit yourself to passing the assessment
Use time sensibly
1 How much study time do you have? Remember that you must eat, sleep, and of course, relax.
2 How will you split that available time between each subject? A revision timetable, covering what and how
you will revise, will help you organise your revision thoroughly.
3 What is your learning style? AM/PM? Little and often/long sessions? Evenings/ weekends?
4 Do you have quality study time? Unplug the phone. Let everybody know that you're studying and shouldn't
be disturbed.
5 Are you taking regular breaks? Most people absorb more if they do not attempt to study for long
uninterrupted periods of time. A five minute break every hour (to make coffee, watch the news headlines)
can make all the difference.
6 Are you rewarding yourself for your hard work? Are you leading a healthy lifestyle?
Introduction vii
What to revise
Key topics
You need to spend most time on, and practise lots of questions on, topics that are likely to yield plenty of
questions in your assessment.
You may also find certain areas of the syllabus difficult.
Difficult areas are
• Areas you find dull or pointless
• Subjects you highlighted as difficult when you studied them
• Topics that gave you problems when you answered questions or reviewed the material
DON’T become depressed about these areas; instead do something about them.
• Build up your knowledge by quick tests such as the quick quizzes in your BPP Learning Media Study Text
and the batches of questions in the i-Pass CD ROM.
• Work carefully through examples and questions in the Text, and refer back to the Text if you struggle with
questions in the Kit.
Breadth of revision
Make sure your revision covers all areas of the syllabus. Your assessment will test your knowledge of the whole
syllabus.
How to revise
There are four main ways that you can revise a topic area.
Write it!
Read it!
Teach it!
Do it!
Write it!
Writing important points down will help you recall them, particularly if your notes are presented in a way that makes
it easy for you to remember them.
viii Introduction
Read it!
You should read your notes or BPP Learning Media Passcards actively, testing yourself by doing quick quizzes or
Kit questions while you are reading.
Teach it!
Assessments require you to show your understanding. Teaching what you are learning to another person helps you
practise explaining topics that you might be asked to define in your assessment. Teaching someone who will
challenge your understanding, someone for example who will be taking the same assessment as you, can be helpful
to both of you.
Do it!
Remember that you are revising in order to be able to answer questions in the assessment. Practising questions
will help you practise technique and discipline, which can be crucial in passing or failing assessments.
1 Start your question practice by doing a couple of sets of objective test questions in a subject area. Note
down the questions where you went wrong, try to identify why you made mistakes and go back to your
Study Text for guidance or practice.
2 The more questions you do, the more likely you are to pass the assessment. However if you do run short of
time:
• Make sure that you have done at least some questions from every section of the syllabus
• Look through the banks of questions and do questions on areas that you have found difficult or on
which you have made mistakes
3 When you think you can successfully answer questions on the whole syllabus, attempt the two mock
assessments at the end of the Kit. You will get the most benefit by sitting them under strict assessment
conditions, so that you gain experience of the vital assessment processes.
• Managing your time
• Producing answers
BPP Learning Media's Learning to Learn Accountancy gives further valuable advice on how to approach revision.
BPP Learning Media has also produced other vital revision aids.
• Passcards – Provide you with clear topic summaries and assessment tips
• i-Pass CDs – Offer you tests of knowledge to be completed against the clock
• MCQ cards – Offer you practise in MCQs

Introduction ix
Assessment technique
Format of the assessment
The assessment will contain 50 questions to be completed in 2 hours. The questions will be a combination of
multiple choice questions and other types of objective test questions.
Passing assessments
Passing assessments is half about having the knowledge, and half about doing yourself full justice in the
assessment. You must have the right approach to two things.
The day of the assessment
Your time in the assessment room
The day of the assessment
1 Set at least one alarm (or get an alarm call) for a morning assessment.
2 Have something to eat but beware of eating too much; you may feel sleepy if your system is digesting a
large meal.
3 Allow plenty of time to get to the assessment room; have your route worked out in advance and listen to
news bulletins to check for potential travel problems.
4 Don't forget pens and watch. Also make sure you remember entrance documentation and evidence of
identity.
5 Put new batteries into your calculator and take a spare set (or a spare calculator).
6 Avoid discussion about the assessment with other candidates outside the assessment room.
Your time in the assessment room
1 Listen carefully to the invigilator's instructions
Make sure you understand the formalities you have to complete.
2 Ensure you follow the instructions on the computer screen
In particular ensure that you select the correct assessment (not every student does!), and that you
understand how to work through the assessment and submit your answers.
x Introduction
3 Keep your eye on the time
In the assessment you will have to complete 50 questions in 120 minutes. That will mean that you have
roughly 2½ minutes on average to answer each question. You will be able to answer some questions
instantly, but others will require thinking about. If after a minute or so you have no idea how to tackle the
question, leave it and come back to it later.
4 Label your workings clearly with the question number
This will help you when you check your answers, or if you come back to a question that you are unsure
about.
5 Deal with problem questions
There are two ways of dealing with questions where you are unsure of the answer.
(a) Don't submit an answer. The computer will tell you before you move to the next question that you
have not submitted an answer, and the question will be marked as not done on the list of questions.
The risk with this approach is that you run out of time before you do submit an answer.
(b) Submit an answer. You can always come back and change the answer before you finish the
assessment or the time runs out. You should though make a note of answers that you are unsure
about, to ensure that you do revisit them later in the assessment.
6 Make sure you submit an answer for every question
When there are ten minutes left to go, concentrate on submitting answers for all the questions that you have
not answered up to that point. You won’t get penalised for wrong answers so take a guess if you're unsure.
7 Check your answers
If you finish the assessment with time to spare, check your answers before you sign out of the assessment.
In particular revisit questions that you are unsure about, and check that your answers are in the right format
and contain the correct number of words as appropriate.
BPP Learning Media's Learning to Learn Accountancy gives further valuable advice on how to approach the
day of the assessment.
Introduction xi
Tackling multiple choice questions
The MCQs in your assessment contain a number of possible answers. You have to choose the option(s) that best
answers the question. The three incorrect options are called distracters. There is a skill in answering MCQs quickly
and correctly. By practising MCQs you can develop this skill, giving you a better chance of passing the assessment.
You may wish to follow the approach outlined below, or you may prefer to adapt it.
Step 1 Note down how long you should allocate to each MCQ. For this paper you will be answering 50
questions in 120 minutes, so you will be spending on average just under two and a half minutes on
each question. Remember however that you will not be expected to spend an equal amount of time
on each MCQ; some can be answered instantly but others will take time to work out.
Step 2 Attempt each question. Read the question thoroughly.
You may find that you recognise a question when you sit the assessment. Be aware that the detail
and/or requirement may be different. If the question seems familiar read the requirement and options
carefully – do not assume that it is identical.
Step 3 Read the four options and see if one matches your own answer. Be careful with numerical questions,
as the distracters are designed to match answers that incorporate common errors. Check that your
calculation is correct. Have you followed the requirement exactly? Have you included every stage of a
calculation?
Step 4 You may find that none of the options matches your answer.
• Re-read the question to ensure that you understand it and are answering the requirement
• Eliminate any obviously wrong answers
• Consider which of the remaining answers is the most likely to be correct and select the
option
Step 5 If you are still unsure, continue to the next question. Likewise if you are nowhere near working out
which option is correct after a couple of minutes, leave the question and come back to it later. Make
a note of any questions for which you have submitted answers, but you need to return to later. The
computer will list any questions for which you have not submitted answers.
Step 6 Revisit questions you are uncertain about. When you come back to a question after a break you
often find you are able to answer it correctly straight away. If you are still unsure have a guess. You
are not penalised for incorrect answers, so never leave a question unanswered!
xii Introduction
Tackling objective test questions
What is an objective test question?
An objective test (OT) question is made up of some form of stimulus, usually a question, and a requirement to do
something.
• MCQs. Read through the information on page (xi) about MCQs and how to tackle them.
• True or false. You will be asked if a statement is true or false.
• Data entry. This type of OT requires you to provide figures such as the correct figure for payables in a
statement of financial position, or words to fill in a blank.
• Multiple response. These questions provide you with a number of options and you have to identify those
that fulfil certain criteria.
OT questions in your assessment
CIMA is currently developing different types of OTs for inclusion in computer-based assessments. The timetable for
introduction of new types of OTs is uncertain, and it is also not certain how many questions in your assessment will
be MCQs, and how many will be other types of OT. Practising all the different types of OTs that this Kit provides will
prepare you well for whatever questions come up in your assessment.
Dealing with OT questions
Again you may wish to follow the approach we suggest, or you may be prepared to adapt it.
Step 1 Work out how long you should allocate to each OT. Remember that you will not be expected to spend
an equal amount of time on each one; some can be answered instantly but others will take time to
work out.
Step 2 Attempt each question. Read the question thoroughly, and note in particular what the question says
about the format of your answer and whether there are any restrictions placed on it (for example the
number of words you can use).
You may find that you recognise a question when you sit the assessment. Be aware that the detail
and/or requirement may be different. If the question seems familiar read the requirement and options
carefully – do not assume that it is identical.
Step 3 Read any options you are given and select which ones are appropriate. Check that your calculations
are correct. Have you followed the requirement exactly? Have you included every stage of the
calculation?
Introduction xiii
Step 4 You may find that you are unsure of the answer.
• Re-read the question to ensure that you understand it and are answering the requirement
• Eliminate any obviously wrong options if you are given a number of options from which to
choose
Step 5 If you are still unsure, continue to the next question. Make a note of any questions for which you
have submitted answers, but you need to return to later. The computer will list any questions for
which you have not submitted answers.
Step 6 Revisit questions you are uncertain about. When you come back to a question after a break you often
find you are able to answer it correctly straight away. If you are still unsure have a guess. You are not
penalised for incorrect answers, so never leave a question unanswered!

1 Introduction to financial accounting
1 B Remember you were asked for the main aim.
2 C Overstating profits and understating statement of financial position asset values.
3 D Improvements are capital expenditure, repairs and maintenance are not.
4 A Shareholders and government are users of accounts.
5 D Correct. This is not an objective from the statement of principles. Additional data is required to
assess this.
A This is a primary objective.
B Again, a major objective.
C All classes of users require information for decision making.
6 A Correct. This information is a need for the 'lender' group.
B This is an important need, particularly relative to other investment opportunities.
C A primary need.
D A major need for existing (and prospective) investors.
2 Basic bookkeeping I
1 A A credit balance in the books of X means that X owes Y this amount ie Y is a payable of X.
2 C Trade discounts are not included in the cost of purchases.
3 C Sales less returns inwards. Discounts allowed are shown as a deduction from gross profit.
4 B Correct, invoices are listed on receipt.
A Incorrect, these are recorded in a memorandum column in the cash book prior to posting to Payables
accounts and the discount received account.
C Incorrect, the supplier will deduct trade discounts prior to raising the invoice total.
D They would be recorded in the purchase returns day book in response to debit notes raised on
suppliers.
5 D Remember the receivables account is a memorandum account.
6 A The total of the cash paid column should be credited to the cash control account, and the total of the
discounts received column to the credit of discounts received, and debited to the payables control
account.
7 D When cash is received by a business, a debit entry is made in the cashbook. A receipt of cash
decreases an overdraft and increases a bank balance.
96 Answers to multiple choice questions
8 C Correct, the sales tax a/c is a personal a/c with the tax authorities.
A Incorrect, the sales tax a/c has not been used to record the output tax charged.
B Incorrect, the $200 represents the amount chargeable to sales tax.
D Incorrect, a complete reversal has occurred and the nominal account involved is incorrect (payables
record purchase ledger transactions).
9 D A liability or a revenue.
10 C The sales ledger. This is posted from the sales day book and cash book.
3 Basic bookkeeping II
1 C Ledger accounts are posted from books of prime entry.
2 C A = L + C. Remember that profit = I – E.
3 B $
Opening capital 10,000
Capital introduced 4,000
Drawings (8,000)
Loss (bal fig) (1,500)
Closing capital 4,500
4 D You are told that X is a receivable of Y. Therefore X normally owes Y money. Options B and C would
imply that Y is a receivable of X and so can be ignored. Option A would increase the debit entry.
Only option D would generate a credit entry.
4 Concepts
1 A Fails to take account of changing price levels over time.
2 D Current purchasing power accounting.
3 C Assets less liabilities = opening capital plus profits less drawings.
∴ Assets less liabilities less opening capital plus drawings = profit
4 D Separate entity concept. A business is separate from its owner.
5 A Accruals concept.
6 D Once capital has been maintained, anything earned in excess is profit.
7 B This is just a rewording of a previous question, be careful with these in the exam.
8 C Depreciation is an application of the accruals concept.
9 C In this way receivables are not overstated and accounts can be compared between periods.
10 C Only realised profits can be included in the Income statement.

A Incorrect, returns and inventory changes must be allowed for.
C Incorrect, changes in inventory levels must be allowed for.
D Incorrect, you have transposed opening and closing inventories.
4 B Correct. This loss is not part of cost of sales.
A This is a reversal error.
C Incorrect; loss of inventory is an expense, if the inventory had been for proprietors own use then the
drawings account would be used.
D Incorrect; the inventory has disappeared, the debit to Inventory will increase inventory!
5 B Correct. The amount which can be realised, less any further expenses.
A Incorrect.
C Incorrect.
D Incorrect.
104 Answers to multiple choice questions
6 A Correct, FIFO will produce the highest valuation of closing inventory of the three methods, giving the
higher profit figure.
B Incorrect, under LIFO costing closing inventory will be valued at the earlier prices.
C Incorrect, LIFO is not permissible under IAS 2.
D Incorrect, average cost will be recalculated after every new delivery into Inventory occurs.
7 C Correct, the inventory would be included at the lower of cost or NRV – assuming it was saleable at a
profit the appropriate cost would be that relating to its finished goods state.

C Incorrect, again this would reduce the purchase ledger total.
D Incorrect, this would reduce the purchase ledger balance.

3 B Opening inventory is a debit balance.
4 B The journal for this transaction is debit drawings and credit purchases. Thus, profit rises and net

19 Sole trader's accounts
1 A Decrease = $400 + $1,200 – $250.
2 D Correct. A margin of 20% on sales equates to a gross profit of 25% (mark up) on cost of sales. So
total margin = 20% × 150,000 = 30,000. Cost of sales is 150,000 – 30,000 = 120,000. Purchases are
120,000 + 15,000 – 10,000 = $125,000.
A Incorrect, you have reversed the opening and closing Inventory figures.
B Incorrect, you have ignored the mark up entirely.

2 A Correct. 25% margin = 331
/3% mark up. Cost of sales = 18,000 + 300,000 – 28,000 = 290,000. Mark
up = 290,000 × 331
/3% = $96,666, so sales = $386,666.
B Incorrect, you have applied the 25% margin to cost of sales.
Answers to multiple choice questions 115
C Incorrect because you have transposed the inventory figures in the calculation of cost of sales.
D Incorrect you have applied a mark up to purchases without the inventory adjustment.
3 D Correct. $500,000 sales × 20% margin (25% mark up = 20% margin) = gross profit $100,000. Cost
of sales = 400,000. Therefore closing inventory = 420,000 – 400,000 + 15,000 = $35,000.
A This is opening inventory.
B This is the difference between cost of sales and purchases ignoring inventory changes.
C You have incorrectly applied the mark up to sales.
4 A Correct, 25% mark up = 20% margin so gross profit = 500,000 × 20% = 100,000. Therefore cost of
sales = 400,000. Opening inventory was $10,000 and closing inventory was $20,000. Therefore cost
of sales should have been 10,000 + 450,000 – 20,000 = 440,000. So losses = 440,000 – 400,000 =
40,000.
B Incorrect, you have applied the mark up % to sales.
C Incorrect, you have transposed opening and closing inventories in the calculation of theoretic cost of
goods sold.
D Incorrect, you have forgotten to include the value of the remaining closing inventory and the original
opening inventory.
5 D Correct, calculate purchases in the period = $6,000 + $37,000 − $4,000 = $39,000. Sales $5,000 ×
margin 20% = $10,000, therefore cost of goods sold is calculated as $40,000.
Opening inventory 5,000 + purchases 39,000 = $44,000 (theoretical cost of goods sold)
Cost of goods sold as calculated $40,000
Inventory loss $ 4,000
A Payables figures have been reversed in the calculation of purchases.
B Incorrect, payables have been ignored.

7 JSL operates the imprest system for its petty cash with a float of $750. At the end of July, the cashier
prepared a spreadsheet for the petty cash expenses with a total column and analysis columns. A cash
voucher for petrol for $50 was incorrectly entered as $5 in the total column and also in one of the analysis
columns in the spreadsheet. The total column was posted to the cash account, the analysis columns were

expenditure on the spreadsheet.
The effect of this error would be
